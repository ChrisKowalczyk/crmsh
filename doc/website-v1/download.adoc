The easiest way to install `crmsh` is via the package manager of your distribution.

== SLES / openSUSE ==

`crmsh` is commercially supported on SLE via the https://www.suse.com/products/highavailability/[SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension]. It is also available for openSUSE with the package name `crmsh`. Development packages can be downloaded from the OBS:

* https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/network:ha-clustering:Stable/crmsh[Stable version]
* https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/network:ha-clustering:Factory/crmsh[Development version]

== Red Hat / CentOS / Fedora ==

We try to build Red Hat / CentOS / Fedora-compatible RPM packages on the OBS (see above).

=== CentOS 7 ===

== Debian ==

The versions of `crmsh` and `pacemaker` currently available in the latest Debian release are quite old. Newer packages are available via the Debian-HA team https://wiki.debian.org/Debian-HA[wiki] and the distribution packages will hopefully be updated soon.

== Ubuntu ==

Packages for `crmsh` are available from the https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/crmsh[Launchpad].

== Gentoo ==

A fairly up-to-date version is available https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-cluster/crmsh[here].

== Arch ==

`crmsh` is available via the https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ha-pacemaker-crmsh/[AUR]. Unfortunately the package seems somewhat out of date.

== Source Packages ==

Releases are available as `.tar.gz` or `.zip` archives via https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/releases[Github].
