The `crm` cluster management shell is an advanced *command-line
interface* for the Pacemaker High Availability stack in
GNU/Linux.

Effortlessly configure, manage and troubleshoot
your clusters from the command line, with full tab completion and
extensive help. `crmsh` provides advanced features like low-level
cluster configuration, cluster scripting, package management,
and history exploration tools giving you a complete insight into what
your cluster is doing.
