The `crm` cluster management shell is a command line
interface for the Pacemaker High Availability stack in
GNU/Linux.

Configure, manage and troubleshoot HA clusters from the command line,
with full tab completion and extensive help. `crmsh` also provides
advanced features like low-level cluster configuration, cluster scripting,
package management, and history exploration tools giving you a complete
insight into the state of your cluster.
