shortdesc: OCFS2 Filesystem
longdesc: >
  Configure an OCFS2 Filesystem resource and add
  it to a cloned DLM base group. OCFS2 uses the
  cluster membership services from Pacemaker which
  run in user space. Therefore, DLM needs to be
  configured as a clone resource that is present on
  each node in the cluster.

  The Filesystem resource should be added to a cloned
  group which includes the DLM resource. This wizard
  can optionally create both the required DLM resource
  and the cloned group. The wizard can be reused to create
  additional OCFS2 Filesystem resources by setting the
  group name to the name of an already-created cloned group.

  If you are using cLVM, create the DLM resource and clone
  group using the cLVM wizard. OCFS2 Filesystem resources can
  then be added to the group using this wizard.
