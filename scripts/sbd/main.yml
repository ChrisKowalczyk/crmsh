longdesc: |
  Create a SBD STONITH resource. SBD must be configured to use
  a particular shared storage device using /etc/sysconfig/sbd.

  There is quite a bit more to do to make this SBD operational.
  See http://www.linux-ha.org/wiki/SBD_Fencing for information, or
  the sbd(8) manual page.

parameters:
  - name: id
    shortdesc: The resource id (name)
    example: stonith-sbd
    required: true
    type: resource
  - name: sbd_device
    shortdesc: Name of the device (shared disk)
    longdesc: >
      Shared device used by SBD. Make sure that the device
      remains the same on reboots. It's preferable to use
      udev generated names rather than the usual /dev/sd[N].
